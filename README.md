Presently, the traffic department in various cities doesn't have any record of traffic passing
through various freeways or they use hardware based approach to do that which turns out to be
quite costly and requires maintenance. Having a good record of traffic can be used to improve
and implement various developmental projects in a proper way. Thus, we will be building a
solution to count the vehicles passing under a bridge in a video. This will be done in C++
using OpenCV library.

This idea can further be extended to detect and record the speed of vehicle eliminating the
use of expensive hand-held speed detecting devices used by traffic police. A software solution
to this will be a cheaper alternative. We can even extend it further and use it to recognize a
License plate. This could be informative to track a suspect and the freeway/route on which
that vehicle was seen last. This could be done only if we use high resolution CCTV cameras
and not normal CCTV cameras. But for now, we will be detecting count of vehicles in a video.
